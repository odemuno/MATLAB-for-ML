# Programming Assignment #1 - Linear Regression ML (optional part)
I decided to complete this section for extra practice, and also so that I know how to work with multiple variables.

## Linear Regression with Multiple Variables
> In this part, you will implement linear regression with multiple variables to
predict the prices of houses. Suppose you are selling your house and you
want to know what a good market price would be. One way to do this is to
rst collect information on recent houses sold and make a model of housing
prices.
