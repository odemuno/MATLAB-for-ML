# Machine Learning Course on Coursera 
 A collection of all my Programming Exercises for this [online course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome).

For each Programming Exercise, I would be highlighting important aspects of it like the algorithms, equations, functions, topics covered, the assignment objective and my reflections.

I may include plots and tables, if necessary.

 Applications used:
 - MATLAB 
 - Octave
 - Microsoft Visual Studio Code
