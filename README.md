# Machine Learning Course on Coursera 
 A collection of all my Programming Exercises for this [online course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome).

NOTE: I will not be posting my solutions because that would violate the [Coursera Honor Code](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code).

> You may not share your solutions to homework, quizzes, or exams with anyone else unless explicitly permitted by the instructor. This includes anything written by you, as well as any official solutions provided by the course staff.

For each Programming Exercise, I would be highlighting important aspects of it like the algorithms, equations, functions, topics covered, the assignment objective and my reflections.

I may include plots and tables, if necessary.

 Applications used:
 - MATLAB 
 - Octave (for a couple exercises)
 - Microsoft Visual Studio Code
