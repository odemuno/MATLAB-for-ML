# MATLAB OnRamp Projects

[MATLAB OnRamp](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/) is a 1-2hr interactive introduction to MATLAB programming.

I am currently on week 2 of the [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) by Stanford university on coursera. This section is titled "More Octave/MATLAB resources" and MATLAB OnRamp was recommended for a quick refresh.

I have previously taken a linear algebra course at UCSD (MATH 18), so I decided to just refresh my memory by completing this learning module.
